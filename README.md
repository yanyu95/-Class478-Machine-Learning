Assignment 2

Question and Description 

For this assignment you will experiment with various classification models using subsets of some real-world data sets. In particular, you will use the K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm to classify text documents, experiment with and compare classifiers that are part of the scikit-learn machine learning package for Python, and use some additional preprocessing capabilities of pandas and scikit-learn packages.
